# Vaccination Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive and insightful vaccination data visualization dashboard using Tableau Public. The goal is to analyze and present global vaccination trends across multiple countries, years, and vaccine types to support public health monitoring and decision-making.

## Data Description
The project uses a structured database consisting of dimension tables (countries, years, vaccines) and fact tables (vaccination coverage). The data has been carefully cleaned, consolidated, and normalized from multiple raw sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Features
- Geographic visualizations highlighting vaccination coverage by country.
- Time series analysis of vaccination trends by year and vaccine type.
- Comparative charts showing vaccine usage across regions.
- Interactive filters to explore data by country, year, and vaccine.

## How to Use
1. Open the Tableau Public workbook.
2. Connect to the provided consolidated CSV data or data sources.
3. Navigate through the interactive dashboards and use filters to explore insights.
4. Export visualizations or data as needed for reports or presentations.

## Requirements
- Tableau Public (free desktop application).
- Access to the project CSV files containing dimension and fact data.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporation of updated vaccination coverage and disease incidence data.
- Addition of more detailed antigen and vaccine component visualizations.
- Integration with real-time data sources for dynamic dashboards.
